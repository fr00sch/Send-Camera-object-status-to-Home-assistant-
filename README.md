# Send-Camera-object-status-to-Home-assistant-

The primary goal of this project is to detect garbage bins in a specified area of an image using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model and then report these detections via an MQTT broker. The system will also send images containing detected garbage bins to another MQTT topic for visualization or further processing.
